**Head of Engineering | ArnoldAI | Vienna, Austria                                          	         January 2024 \- November 2025**

* Leading engineering for an AI platform providing chatbot agents, agent builder, and RAG systems for highly regulated industries.  
* Managing a team of 8 (6 developers, 1 QA, 1 EA), overseeing all development while establishing Scrumban workflows, coding guidelines, Git branching strategies, and documentation standards for compliance.  
* Architected cloud infrastructure for horizontal scaling; decoupled services across VMs with private network communication, increasing concurrent user capacity by 3-4x.  
* Designed and shipped major platform features: market intelligence assistant with ReAct agentic flow, multi-workspace tenancy, agent memory layer, code interpreter tool, and security audit logs.  
* Led migration from legacy LLM infrastructure to LangChain and introduced LangGraph for complex workflows and multi-agent architecture.  
* Reduced Docker build times by implementing BuildKit caching and migrating from pip to uv for dependency management.  
* Created system design artifacts (data flows, ERDs, information architecture) for features including assistant management and security logging.

**Part-time Software Engineer | CoolRiots | Singapore                                                   January 2025 \- February 2025**

* Led architecture redesign for a generative UI system that dynamically renders interactive dashboards and data visualizations from natural language queries.  
* Identified architectural bottlenecks and pivoted the project from a complex multi-agent proposal to a streamlined single-agent design, eliminating unnecessary database storage.  
* Delivered a working MVP within 2 months, generating JSON-based UI definitions and proving feasibility without over-engineering.  
* Replaced Server-Side Rendering (SSR) overhead with client-side rendering strategies to optimize performance.  
* Created comprehensive system design documentation and presented the technical roadmap to leadership, securing endorsement for the new architectural direction.
