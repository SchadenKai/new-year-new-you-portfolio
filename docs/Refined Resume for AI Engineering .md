**RELEVANT EXPERIENCE**

**Head of Engineering | ArnoldAI | Vienna, Austria (Remote)                                    January 2024 \- November 2025**

* **Production RAG & Continuous Refinement:** Engineered high-accuracy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for complex medical and defense protocols. Established a continuous deployment lifecycle for **SME agents**, utilizing live feedback loops to refine retrieval strategies and update vector stores, ensuring reliable domain authority in production environments.  
* **Advanced LLM Workflows & MAS Orchestration:** Architected Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) using **LangGraph**, implementing specific cognitive architectures including **ReAct** agents for reasoning and **Plan-and-Execute** patterns for complex task decomposition. Designed agents to function as distinct components—such as planners, executors, and reviewers—orchestrating flow via shared state.  
* **LLM Evaluation & Observability:** Implemented automated evaluation pipelines using **LangSmith** to measure response **correctness, completeness**, and faithfulness. Deployed **"LLM-as-a-Judge"** evaluators to audit agent interactions at scale, significantly reducing hallucination rates and ensuring compliance with strict healthcare standards.  
* **Infrastructure Migration & DevOps:** Orchestrated a strategic infrastructure migration from **AWS (EC2 & Lambda)** to **Hetzner** bare-metal virtual machines to optimize operational costs and control. Provisioned the new environment using **Terraform** and **Ansible**, and deployed containerized microservices via **Kubernetes**, ensuring high availability for concurrent agent workflows.

**Senior Software Engineer (Contract) | CoolRiots | Singapore (Remote)                    January 2025 \- February 2025**

* **Adaptive Content Generation:** Architected a "Generative UI" system that dynamically renders interactive dashboards from natural language queries. This architecture demonstrates the capability to generate customized learning materials in real-time based on student needs.  
* **Prompt Engineering & Optimization:** Pivoted architecture from a complex multi-agent proposal to a streamlined single-agent design via advanced prompt optimization, focusing on the high precision required for interpreting user intent.  
* **Performance Engineering:** Optimized payload delivery by replacing Server-Side Rendering (SSR) overhead with client-side strategies, ensuring seamless interaction with complex data structures.
